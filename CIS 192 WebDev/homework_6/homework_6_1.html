          <strong>CSS &#40;Cascading Style Sheets&#41;</strong> describes how
          the webpage is styled for visual presentation&#46; The applied style
          rules <strong>cascade downfrom general to more specific</strong> with
          the more specific rules <strong>overriding</strong> more general rules
        </p>
        <div id="cssSelectorP">
          <p>A <strong>CSS Rule</strong> consists of&#58;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <strong>selector</strong>&#58; Specifies the HTML elements to
              which the style rules apply
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>declaration block</strong>&#58; Contains one or more
              declarations separated by semicolons

            <li>
              <strong>Styling Declarations</strong>&#58; Each styling
              declaration is a line with a key&#58;value pair and ending with a
              semicolon <strong>&#40;&#59;&#41;</strong>

        <ul>

            <strong>Inline Declarations</strong>&#58; Inline declarations are
            written as the value to the <strong>style attribute</strong> and are
            also key&#58; value&#59; pairs inside quotes&#46; No curly braces

            <strong>Embedded CSS</strong>&#58; Embedded css is written between
            two <strong>&#60;style&#62; tags</strong> in between the
            <strong>&#60;head&#62;</strong> tags of your html document

        <h3>Inheritance And Conflict</h3>
        <p>
          When two style declarations with identical properties apply to the
          same element a <strong>conflict</strong> occurs&#46; Two common types
          of conflicts are&#58;
        </p>
        <ul style="color: blue">
          <li style="background: orange">
            A <strong>parent&#39;s declaration</strong> conflicts with a
            <strong>child&#39;s declaration</strong>&#58; When this conflict
            occurs&#44; the child&#39;s declaration overrides the parent&#39;s
            declaration
          </li>
          <li style="color: black; background: blue">
            An <strong>embedded or external style sheet</strong> conflicts with
            an <strong>inline declaration</strong>&#58; When this conflict
            occurs&#44; the inline declaration <strong>overrides</strong> the
            external or embedded declarations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          See the code for this unordered list for an example of how conflicts
          occur and how they are resolved&#33;

      <!-- Specificity and !Important-->
      <section id="specificty">
        <h3>Specificity and &#33;important</h3>
        <p>
          A browser uses <strong>specificity</strong> which is like a scoring
          system to apply css rules appropriately. In more complex cases you may
          wish to override this&#46; To do so you would need to add the
          <strong>&#33;important</strong> rule right before ending a declaration
          line&#46; This overrides all other declarations&#46; However&#44; this
          is not good practice as implementation changes can easily become
          overly complex&#33;

    <!-- Example -->
    <section id="example" style="color: red">
      <p style="color: inherit">
        Another value that can be assigned to CSS
        <strong>property values</strong> is the
        <strong>inherit</strong> value&#33; For example&#44; in this paragraph I
        have assigned the property of color to the value inherit&#46; By default
        the text should be black&#44; but since I have made it inherit the color
        of its parent&#44; it will now be red&#33; Changing the color of the
        parent container will now effectively change the color of this paragraph
        as well
