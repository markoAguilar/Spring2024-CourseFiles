	It is recommended to not use the image tag itself to modify the height or width elements<br>
	within the image tag.

	<p>We started doing the lab assignment involving tables</p>
	<p><br>Below is the code for it that was done</p>

	<table>
		<caption>Red Rock, CO</caption>
		<tr> <!--First Row with only headers-->
			<th>Photo</th>
			<th>Date</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>

		<tr> <!--Second Row of only data-->
			<td><img src="vacation1.jpg" alt="photo of the beach"></td> 		<!--Photo-->
			<td>October 1, 2020</td>				<!--Date-->
			<td>The most awesome beach you ever did see!</td>	<!--Description-->
		</tr>
		<!--Do the same for the remaining rows-->
		<!--Note that there was a cellspan attribute that the lab asked you to include too -->

		<p>Previously we learned about the anchor tag a and how it has an attribute href that is <br>
		set to the value of the website or file for which to load. We can however also make an image<br>
		be the clickable element for this link by inserting an img tag within the a tag</p>
